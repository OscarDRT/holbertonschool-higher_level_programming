#### Simple rectangle
 Write a class  `Rectangle`  that defines a rectangle by: (based on  `8-rectangle.py`)

-   Private instance attribute:  `width`:
    -   property  `def width(self):`  to retrieve it
    -   property setter  `def width(self, value):`  to set it:
        -   `width`  must be an integer, otherwise raise a  `TypeError`  exception with the message  `width must be an integer`  
            
        -   if  `width`  is less than  `0`, raise a  `ValueError`  exception with the message  `width must be >= 0`
-   Private instance attribute:  `height`:
    -   property  `def height(self):`  to retrieve it
    -   property setter  `def height(self, value):`  to set it:
        -   `height`  must be an integer, otherwise raise a  `TypeError`  exception with the message  `height must be an integer`  
            
        -   if  `height`  is less than  `0`, raise a  `ValueError`  exception with the message  `height must be >= 0`
-   Public class attribute  `number_of_instances`:
    -   Initialized to  `0`
    -   Incremented during each new instance instantiation
    -   Decremented during each instance deletion
-   Public class attribute  `print_symbol`:
    -   Initialized to  `#`
    -   Used as symbol for string representation
    -   Can be any type
-   Instantiation with optional  `width`  and  `height`:  `def __init__(self, width=0, height=0):`
-   Public instance method:  `def area(self):`  that returns the rectangle area
-   Public instance method:  `def perimeter(self):`  that returns the rectangle perimeter:
    -   if  `width`  or  `height`  is equal to  `0`, perimeter has to be equal to  `0`
-   `print()`  and  `str()`  should print the rectangle with the character  `#`:
    -   if  `width`  or  `height`  is equal to 0, return an empty string
-   `repr()`  should return a string representation of the rectangle to be able to recreate a new instance by using  `eval()`
-   Print the message  `Bye rectangle...`  (`...`  being 3 dots not ellipsis) when an instance of  `Rectangle`  is deleted
-   Static method  `def bigger_or_equal(rect_1, rect_2):`  that returns the biggest rectangle based on the area
    -   `rect_1`  must be an instance of  `Rectangle`, otherwise raise a  `TypeError`  exception with the message  `rect_1 must be an instance of Rectangle`  
        
    -   `rect_2`  must be an instance of  `Rectangle`, otherwise raise a  `TypeError`  exception with the message  `rect_2 must be an instance of Rectangle`  
        
    -   Returns  `rect_1`  if both have the same area value
-   Class method  `def square(cls, size=0):`  that returns a new Rectangle instance with  `width == height == size`
